# Mithril Demo for "Small Footprint JavaScript" lightning talk @ NEDev

# Getting it running

Install the dependencies (warning: may take some time!) using `npm install`

Then run the project using `gulp`

Please Note:

This project uses a personal [fork](https://github.com/stephen-james/gulp-starter) of [gulp-starter](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter) which works great for playing around, but the fork I made has some issues surrounding source maps, which are inlined into the output unminified files.

You can switch this to minified mode in: `gulp/tasks/browserify.js`.

# Walking through

The commits in this repo correspond to the code as it was evolved in the demo.

Simply check out each commit in turn, or use the slide git tags `1` through `6`.

There are some additional commits to give more detail than those shown in the demo.
